Collapsible Sidebar Task

This is a simple, responsive, and collapsible sidebar task built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a smooth slide-in/slide-out animation and is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile screens.

Internship Task

This task was completed as part of my internship with Elevvo. It was a front-end development task focused on building a clean, responsive, and functional UI component that demonstrates a solid understanding of modern web development principles.

Features

    Collapsible Sidebar: A navigation bar that can be toggled open or closed with a button click.

    Smooth Animations: The sidebar and main content transition smoothly, creating a polished user experience.

    Responsive Design: On smaller screens (e.g., mobile phones), the sidebar functions as an overlay to save screen space, with the main content "dimmed" to enhance focus on the navigation.

    Clickable Overlay: When the sidebar is open on a mobile device, clicking the semitransparent overlay closes the sidebar.

    Clean Layout: The project uses a modern CSS layout for a clean and organized look.

Technologies Used

    HTML5: For the page structure.

    CSS3: For styling, animations, and responsive design using media queries.

    JavaScript: To handle the click events and toggle CSS classes.

    Font Awesome: For the navigation icons.
